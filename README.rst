These are my solutions to the problem sets in *Advanced Quantum Field Theory*.

You are welcome to join me and hand in a joint solution to the problems. Just
contact me via email or send me a pull-request with some content and your name
added in the ``\author`` command.

The main LaTeX file should build fine with both ``pdflatex`` and ``lualatex``.
You can also use the ``makefile`` which uses ``lualatex`` and will compile the
standalone TikZ pictures.
