\section{(Non-)abelian gauge invariance}
\label{homework:1}

In the past weeks I have reached another level in understanding the whole
\enquote{Gauge Theory} business \Laughey. You don't have to read this, I just
wanted to share how my understanding progresses as a lot comes from discussions
with you.

\begin{multicols}{2}
    In general relativity one has a \emph{connection}\footnote{%
        In physics that is usually called \enquote{covariant derivative} from
        what I read. I like to stick with the mathematical names since I first
        read those names in the book by \textcite{penrose-road_to_reality}.
    } $\vnabla$ with \emph{connection coefficients}\footnote{%
        And in physics the \emph{connection coefficients} are called
        \enquote{connection}. Who makes this stuff up?
    } $\Gamma^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}$. The connection acting on a vector is then
    given as
    \[
        \nabla_\mu X_\nu
        = \partial_\mu X_\nu + \Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\nu} X_\gamma \,,
    \]
    or at least very close to that.
    Then the equation of motion is
    \[
        m_i \left[ \ddot x^\mu_i + \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^\mu \dot x_i^\alpha
        \dot x_i^\beta \right] = q_i F^\mu{}_\nu \dot x_i^\nu
    \]
    and the Lagrangian density contains a term with the Ricci scalar, which is a
    functional of the Christoffel symbols.

    So the Christoffel symbols, the connection coefficients, were introduced in
    GR in order to have a sensible differentiation as the (co)tangent spaces at
    different points of the manifold are not comparable directly any more. One
    needs to introduce some sort of \emph{connection} (literally) to compare
    the fibers at different points of the underlying manifold. In GR this is
    the tangent bundle which is something I can depict in my imagination. One
    chooses this connection to be the Levi-Civita-connection such that metric
    and affine geodesics coincide. So that is just a complicated way to say
    that the metric tensor is invariant under the connection which is a handy
    thing to have. I think there were more arguments to this specific choice of
    connection but I cannot recall that.

    The connection coefficients then take on a life on their own and contribute
    to the Lagrangian density in form of the Ricci scalar $\mathcal R$. This
    means that the Christoffel symbols obtain some sort of tangible physical
    role and also appear in the equation of motion.

    Now in quantum electromagnetism we start off with $\mathcal L = \bar\psi
    [\iup \slashed\partial - m] \psi$ and note that we have a local symmetry in
    the spinors. The symmetry is a U(1) symmetry which means that our $\psi$
    now is a cross section through the fiber bundle $\R^4 \times \mathrm U(1)$.
    By the way, $\mathrm U(1) \simeq S^1$ and that fiber bundle now looks
    awfully close to the little I know about Kaluzaâ€“Klein theory. Is that a
    coincidence? $\psi(\four x)$ is now a cross section through the fiber
    bundle. Here the bundle is not as easily imaginable as the tangent bundle,
    so it took me a while to wrap my head around that. We are in need of a
    \emph{connection} between the different points in spacetime as each point
    now has a different gauge. Therefore it does not make sense to write
    ordinary derivatives any more. We want a partial derivative in every
    spacetime direction, so we need four connection coefficients. Those are
    called $A_\mu$ knowing what the \enquote{life of its own} will make those
    coefficients.

    Having the connection coefficients, it is simple to write down the
    connection. That is then the \emph{covariant derivative}. Just as in the GR
    case one needs to have a Lagrangian density which transforms with the
    trivial representation of the symmetry group, i.e.\ a scalar. Therefore one
    needs to add terms such that this turns out. In GR it was shown how this
    Lagrangian has to look like. Here we just have to build a Lagrangian
    without any ordinary derivative and match $\bar\psi$ with $\psi$ to give
    Gauge invariant terms. The Lagrangian density therefore is just
    \[
        \mathcal L = \bar\psi[\iup\slashed\nabla - m] \psi - \frac14 F \wedge
        \hodge F \,,
    \]
    where $\nabla$ is the connection and $F$ is a two-form. From here it is
    evident that it is gauge invariant, at least under an abelian gauge
    transformation. Each summand is invariant on its own and that is rather
    beautiful.

    I never thought that I would learn something about electromagnetism by
    studying general relativity. But apparently it served as a very good
    analogy.
