We will indicate four-vectors with bold sans-serif letters (like
$\tens{abcdef}$) instead of using the underline. The underline looks rather
ugly. There should not be any confusion between four-vectors and higher-rank
tensors. This will still allow to discriminate between three-vectors ($\vec
q$,~$\vec k$) and four-vectors ($\four q$,~$\four k$), although the difference
is subtle now. Please tell if you have a preference.

\section{Vacuum polarization}

The photon propagator, we will call it $\pi(\four q)$ is corrected in first
order by the diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:loop}. All corrections are contained in
the corrected propagator $\Pi(\four q)$. The notation is similar to the vertex
correction where $\mat\gamma \mapsto \mat\Gamma$.

The propagator is a rank-2 tensor and therefore has to transform
Lorentz-covariantly. This means it can only be a linear combination of elements
which are rank-2 tensors themselves. For this we have the metric tensor~$\tens
g$ and the product~$\four q \otimes \four q$. All this can multiply a function
which depends on a Lorentz scalar as this will be invariant. The only scalar
that we have is $\four q^2$ which is Lorentz invariant.

Therefore we can have something like
\[
    \Pi^{\mu\nu}(\four q) = \sbr{ [a \four q^2 + b] g^{\mu\nu} + c q^\mu q^\nu
    } \Pi(\four q^2) \,.
\]
The QED Ward identity then says that replacing the polarization vector of an
external photon with the photon's momentum must give zero when contracted. Here
it means that
\[
    q_\mu \Pi^{\mu\nu} = 0 \,,
\]
the relation with $\nu$ contracted directly follows from the symmetry. We only
have to check one of them.
\begin{align*}
    q_\mu \Pi^{\mu\nu}(\four q)
    &= q_\mu \sbr{ [a \four q^2 + b] g^{\mu\nu} + c q^\mu q^\nu } \Pi(\four
    q^2) \\
    &= \sbr{ [a \four q^2 + b] q_\mu g^{\mu\nu} + c q_\mu q^\mu q^\nu }
    \Pi(\four q^2) \\
    &= \sbr{ [a \four q^2 + b] q^\nu + c \four q^2 q^\nu } \Pi(\four q^2) \\
    &= \sbr{ [a \four q^2 + b + c \four q^2] q^\nu } \Pi(\four q^2)
\end{align*}
From here the condition
\[
    [a + c] \four q^2 + b = 0
\]
follows. This can only be fulfilled for any $\four q$ if $a = -c$ and $b = 0$
are given. Therefore the propagator can only have a form as given on the
problem set. The multiple $a$ can be absorbed into the $\Pi(\four q^2)$
function to give Equation~(1) from the problem set.
